# Intuition:
# Use a stack to keep track of unmatched opening brackets.
# When encountering a closing bracket, check if it matches the top of the stack.
# If thereâ€™s any mismatch or leftover opening brackets, the string is invalid.

# Complexity:
# - Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input string
#   (we iterate through the string once and perform O(1) operations for each character).
# - Space complexity: O(n) in the worst case (stack size can grow to the size of the input string
#   if it consists entirely of opening brackets).
